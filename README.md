# panlex\_client 
Simple Ruby client for the [public API](http://dev.panlex.org/api/) of the [Panlex Database](http://panlex.org).

## Usage

Right now, there is just a `PanlexClient` module with only one `query` method which accepts three arguments: the URL parameter, the request body and an optional block to process the response and which accept three arguments: response, request and result.

```ruby
require 'panlex_client'

PanlexClient.query 'lv', { :indent => true, :limit => 2 } do |response, request, result|
   response_json = JSON.parse(response)
   if response_json['status'] == 'OK' then
      response_json['result'].each do |language|
         puts language.to_s
      end
   end
end
```
