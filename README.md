# panlex\_client 
Simple Ruby client for the [public API](http://dev.panlex.org/api/) of the [Panlex Database](http://panlex.org).

## Usage

Right now, there is just a `PanlexClient` module with only one `query` method with two arguments: the URL parameter and the request body. It returns PanLex API response parsed to a Hash.

```ruby
require 'panlex_client'

response = PanlexClient.query 'lv', { :indent => true, :limit => 2 }

if response['status'] == 'OK' then
  response['result'].each do |language|
     puts language['tt']
  end
end

```
