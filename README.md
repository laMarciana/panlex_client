# panlex\_client 

Simple Ruby client for the [public API](http://dev.panlex.org/api/) of the [PanLex Database](http://panlex.org). It uses [rest-client](https://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client) gem.

## Usage

Right now, there is just a `PanlexClient` module with only one `query` method wich takes two arguments: the URL parameter and the request body. It returns PanLex API response parsed to a Hash or raises an exception with the response in it.

```ruby
require 'panlex_client'

begin
  response = PanlexClient.query 'lv', { :indent => true, :limit => 2 }
  response['result'].each do |language|
    puts language['tt']
  end
rescue RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse => e
  puts JSON.parse(e.response)['message']
end
```

## Relase Policy

panlex_client follows the principles of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). panlex_client is still in an 0.x.y version, so it is not considered stable and anything can change at any moment.
